# Hey!
If you're looking for the most supported and most recent version of this plugin,
please look at the master branch. This branch is for those who cannot upgrade to
1.15 and must stay on 1.13. I'll try to backport any new features, though.

# This README is kinda empty.
You're right! For a better README, check out the master branch. I just don't
want to have to keep two separate files consistent and updated. Everything
in the master branch README applies to this branch as well, except for things
about 1.15+ only, of course.
